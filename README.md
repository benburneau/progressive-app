Train. Fuel. Sun.

Progressive is the all-in-one fitness companion that helps you lift consistently, eat without stress, and get safe sunlight — without juggling multiple apps.

WHY PROGRESSIVE  
• Beautiful and frictionless by design — quick set logging, chat food entry that AI understands, one-tap sun sessions.  
• See the whole picture — workouts, calories in/out, and vitamin D on a clean dashboard.  
• Build habits that last — plans, timers, trends, and gentle deltas that highlight progress.

TRAIN  
• Create workout plans (push, pull, legs, or any plan you can think of!).  
• Log sets in seconds; auto-start rest timers to keep flow.  
• Track volume, sets, duration, and gains vs last session with glanceable tiles and 7-day trends.

FUEL  
• Tell it what you ate—type a quick note like “oatmeal 80g + banana.”  
• AI parses your entry and calculates calories & macros automatically.  
• See daily totals, net calories (with HealthKit energy), and 7-day trends.

SUN  
• Start UV-aware sessions with skin type & clothing options.  
• Get safe time estimates with caution and auto-stop notifications.  
• Track vitamin D (IU) to support mood, sleep, and recovery.

PRIVATE BY DESIGN
